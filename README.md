# Coal-Cube-quality_Detection-Project
 The project was implemented using deep learning, where the project examines the coal cube and detects whether there is a defect in the coal cube or whether it is of high quality. If there is a defect, it classifies the defect as either cracks and chips in the coal cube or a deformation in its surface.
